  Stack of pages (EASIEST)
</h3>

1. <p>Download one of the PDFs below. Choose "with cutlines" if you'd like the PDFs to include lines that show you where to cut.

- <img src="/images/file-pdf.png" width="24" height="24"> [4 per page, with cutlines](/downloads/4up-with-cutlines.pdf)
  _(good for scissors)_
- <img src="/images/file-pdf.png" width="24" height="24">  [4 per page, no cutlines](/downloads/4up.pdf) _(good for a paper cutter)_

2. Print out the PDF, single-sided.

4. Cut each page into 4 sheets.

3. Order the pages by page number. (There are only odd-numbered pages, no evens.) Optionally staple the pages together on the side or on the corner.

Enjoy the zine!
