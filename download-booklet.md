  Booklet, using a normal printer
</h3>

<div class="note">

These are instructions for how to make a booklet if you do <strong>not</strong> have a duplex printer. If you do, [read those instructions instead](#duplex) — it's a bit easier!

</div>


1. <p>Download one of the PDFs below. Choose "with cutlines" if you'd like the PDFs to include lines that show you where to cut.

- <img src="/images/file-pdf.png" width="24" height="24"> [fronts, with cutlines](/downloads/fronts-with-cutlines.pdf)
  _(good for scissors)_
- <img src="/images/file-pdf.png" width="24" height="24"> [fronts, no cutlines](/downloads/fronts.pdf) _(good for a paper cutter)_

2. <p>Print out the PDF. <strong>Do not reorder the pages!</strong>

3. Flip over the _whole_ stack of printed pages across the long side of the paper. Put these pages back in your printer's paper feed. Make sure you don't accidentally turn the pages upside-down when doing this.

4. <p>Now download the backs PDF below.

5. <p>Print out the backs PDF. It should be printing on the backsides of the pages you printed on in Step 2.

6. Cut each page into 2 sheets.

7. Fold each page in half, with the lower numbers always showing on the front side.

8. Staple in the middle.

Enjoy the zine!!

<div class="note">

These instructions only work if you have a duplex printer, meaning it can print on both sides of a piece of paper! For regular printers, [follow this instead](#booklet).

</div>

1. <p>Download one of the PDFs below. Choose "with cutlines" if you'd like the PDFs to include lines that show you where to cut.

- <img src="/images/file-pdf.png" width="24" height="24"> [2-sided, with cutlines](/downloads/2-sided-with-cutlines.pdf)
  _(good for scissors)_
- <img src="/images/file-pdf.png" width="24" height="24"> [2-sided, no cutlines](/downloads/2-sided.pdf) _(good for a paper cutter)_

2. <p>Print out the PDF, using your printer's 2-sided printing option. The odd pages of the PDF are the "fronts" of the 2-sided print, and the even pages are the "backs" of the 2-sided print. They should be flipped along the <strong>long edge</strong> of the paper.
