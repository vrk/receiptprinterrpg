  Individual sheets (EASIEST)
</h3>

1. <p>Download one of the PDFs below. Choose "with cutlines" if you'd like the PDFs to include lines that show you where to cut.

- <img src="/images/file-pdf.png" width="24" height="24"> [4 per page, with cutlines](/downloads/4up-with-cutlines.pdf)
  _(good for cutting with scissors)_
- <img src="/images/file-pdf.png" width="24" height="24">  [4 per page, no cutlines](/downloads/4up.pdf) _(good for cutting with paper cutter)_

2. Print out the PDF.

4. Cut each page into 4 sheets.

3. Order the pages by page number. (There are only odd-numbered pages, no evens.) Optionally staple the pages together on the side or on the corner.

Enjoy the zine!

  Booklet, double-sided printing (HARDER but cool)
</h3>


<div class="note">
NOTE: These instructions only work if your printer can print on both sides of a piece of paper!<br>
If you do not have such a printer, follow the <strong>single-sided printing</strong> instructions instead.
</div>

1. <p>Download one of the PDFs below. Choose "with cutlines" if you'd like the PDFs to include lines that show you where to cut.

- <img src="/images/file-pdf.png" width="24" height="24"> [2-sided, with cutlines](/downloads/2-sided-with-cutlines.pdf)
  _(good for cutting with scissors)_
- <img src="/images/file-pdf.png" width="24" height="24"> [2-sided, no cutlines](/downloads/2-sided.pdf) _(good for cutting with paper cutter)_

2. Print out the PDF, using your printer's 2-sided printing option. The odd pages of the PDF are the "fronts" of the 2-sided print, and the even pages are the "backs" of the 2-sided print. They should be flipped along the <strong>long edge</strong> of the paper.

3. Cut each page into 2 sheets.

4. Fold each page in half, with the lower numbers always showing on the front side.

5. Staple in the middle.

Enjoy the zine!!
