# üñ®Ô∏è Print it yourself _(free!)_ üñ®Ô∏è 

You can assemble <em>Receipt Printer RPG</em> either as a üìÑ <em>stack of pages</em> or a  üìñ <em>booklet</em>.

The üìÑ <em>stack of pages</em> option is **significantly easier** to print and assemble correctly, so choose this option if you're low on time and/or paper.

The üìñ <em>booklet</em> option is **arguably cooler** but can be a little tricky, especially if your printer can't do double-sided prints. Choose this option if you are OK with a little more work!


<h3 id="stack">
  <img src="/images/loosesheets.png" height="150"><br>
  Stack of pages (EASIEST)
</h3>

1. <p>Download one of the PDFs below. Choose "with cutlines" if you'd like the PDFs to include lines that show you where to cut.

- <img src="/images/file-pdf.png" width="24" height="24"> [4 per page, with cutlines](/downloads/4up-with-cutlines.pdf)
  _(good for scissors)_
- <img src="/images/file-pdf.png" width="24" height="24">  [4 per page, no cutlines](/downloads/4up.pdf) _(good for a paper cutter)_

2. Print out the PDF.

4. Cut each page into 4 sheets.

3. Order the pages by page number. (There are only odd-numbered pages, no evens.) Optionally staple the pages together on the side or on the corner.

Enjoy the zine!


<h3 id="booklet">

  Booklet, using a normal printer
</h3>

<div class="note">

These are instructions for how to make a booklet if you do <strong>not</strong> have a duplex printer. If you do, [read those instructions instead](#duplex) ‚Äî it's a bit easier!

</div>


1. <p>Download one of the PDFs below. Choose "with cutlines" if you'd like the PDFs to include lines that show you where to cut.

- <img src="/images/file-pdf.png" width="24" height="24"> [fronts, with cutlines](/downloads/fronts-with-cutlines.pdf)
  _(good for scissors)_
- <img src="/images/file-pdf.png" width="24" height="24"> [fronts, no cutlines](/downloads/fronts.pdf) _(good for a paper cutter)_

2. <p>Print out the PDF. <strong>Do not reorder the pages!</strong>

3. Flip over the _whole_ stack of printed pages across the long side of the paper. Put these pages back in your printer's paper feed. Make sure you don't accidentally turn the pages upside-down when doing this.

Enjoy the zine!!

  Booklet, using a duplex printer
</h3>


<div class="note">

These instructions only work if you have a duplex printer, meaning it can print on both sides of a piece of paper! For regular printers, [follow this instead](#duplex).

</div>

1. <p>Download one of the PDFs below. Choose "with cutlines" if you'd like the PDFs to include lines that show you where to cut.

- <img src="/images/file-pdf.png" width="24" height="24"> [2-sided, with cutlines](/downloads/2-sided-with-cutlines.pdf)
  _(good for scissors)_
- <img src="/images/file-pdf.png" width="24" height="24"> [2-sided, no cutlines](/downloads/2-sided.pdf) _(good for a paper cutter)_

2. <p>Print out the PDF, using your printer's 2-sided printing option. The odd pages of the PDF are the "fronts" of the 2-sided print, and the even pages are the "backs" of the 2-sided print. They should be flipped along the <strong>long edge</strong> of the paper.
