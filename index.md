<p>A few moments ago you had been coloring in a zine. <br><br>You were coloring a picture of a QR code, and as you colored you had this thought:

</div>

<blockquote>
It’s like <em>I’m</em> a receipt printer now! <span class="little">I'm a human printer printing a qr code hehe</span>
</blockquote>

<div class="narration">
<p>And as you colored you grew increasingly consumed by this thought

</div>

<div class="fantasy">
<p>Wow, life as a printer...<br> it’s not so bad. 
<p>I like coloring… <br>Relaxing… 
<p>what if I was reborn a printer haha.... 
<p>I would grant people's wishes all day... <span class="little">as long as their wish was a printout</span>
<p>like a genie...<br>to live as a genie...
<p><span class="little">I liked Aladdin…</span>
